# Personal REACT Challenge (Day 2) - (My)stagram app

## Personal challenge
I commited myself to get better with React and started 
this challange to create **one simple react app** every 
single day for the next 7 days. 

I was only a beginner at the beginning, I read few tutorials
on the web, but I wanted to know how I can fully work with 
React. So I started this challenge.

I expect to get real know-how of React and start thinking
in "Component-State-Props" philosophy. 

My challange consisted of:
- HTML Markup
- CSS styling with Styled Components
- REACT interactions, components, states

## Day 2 - (My)stagram 
I got inspired by the simple Instagram app supported for web. I will build the home screen with images posted by as many friends as possible
